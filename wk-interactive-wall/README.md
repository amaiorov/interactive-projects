# Wieden+Kennedy Interactive Wall

## Overview
The team wanted to know what consumers felt about our clients’ brands, in real time.

## Solution
We created the concept of showing consumer sentiment for brands based on how they reacted on social media. Consumer reactions containing the reference to a brand were analyzed and categorized into a “sentiment bucket”, for example:

* happy
* angry
* sad
* indiferent
* curious
* upset

This data was processed through an NLP engine and subsequently color coded to an emotional response, i.e. red for “angry” or green for “happy”. Afterwards, these sentiments were visualized as “bubbles” embedded into the client logo. Each bubble could be tapped to open it and see the actual social media reaction. The data was updated regularly so that live sentiment was visible.

As a result, when Nike, for instance, released a new Jordan sneaker and the consumers’ general reaction was “hey, this design sucks”, the interactive wall would present the Nike swoosh logo filled with primarily red circles. On the contrary, when Delta released an extremely fun safety video and consumers found if funny and like it, the Delta logo would be displayed with “positive” colors.
