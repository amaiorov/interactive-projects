# Bauer Slapshot Simulator

## Overview
The team at VML NY worked on a proof of concept as part of an RFP for our Bauer client. This pitch included a “smart” hockey stick concept. 

## Solution
We came up with the idea of the “smart” hockey stick as something that would help hockey players get an understanding of their playing style by tracking the velocity of the puck based on the strength of their slapshot.

The team created a prototype hockey stick with an embedded device that used the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to track the movement of the hockey stick in 3D space and interpolate the speed of the puck. Users would be able to see the speed of their current slapshot, as well as track a history of previous ones.

## Responsibilities
* create prototype “smart” hockey stick
* build interface for users to see data of their slapshots
