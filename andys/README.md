# International Andy Awards Microsite

## Overview
The International Andy Awards is the annual ceremony celebrating creative excellence and bold thinking in the advertising industry. Our team at Wieden+Kennedy NY was tasked with creating the website for the 2016 awards. The tagline, "Beat the Best and Win an ANDY” was executed upon with creating “the best website ever”.

## Solution
What makes “the best” website? Content, of course! The site inspired collaboration from people who visited and would add their own content from five categories:

* video
* text
* image
* meme
* music

Keeping the motto in mind, users could also upvote the content that they liked. Over time, and as users added more and more content, the site used an algorithm that would display more popular content at the top based on user interaction.

The goal was for the site get better and better, and ultimately become “the perfect site”, as decided by users themselves.

## Responsibilities
* building out the microsite
* creating “best content” algorithm
* creating moderation interface to prevent “bad” content from showing up
