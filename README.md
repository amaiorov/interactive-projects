## International Andy Awards Microsite

### Problem Statement
The International Andy Awards is the annual ceremony celebrating creative excellence and bold thinking in the advertising industry. Our team at Wieden+Kennedy NY was tasked with creating the website for the 2016 awards. The tagline, "Beat the Best and Win an ANDY” was executed upon with creating “the best website ever”.

### Solution
What makes “the best” website? Content, of course! The site inspired collaboration from people who visited and would add their own content from five categories:

* video
* text
* image
* meme
* music

Keeping the motto in mind, users could also upvote the content that they liked. Over time, and as users added more and more content, the site used an algorithm that would display more popular content at the top based on user interaction.

The goal was for the site get better and better, and ultimately become “the perfect site”, as decided by users themselves.

### Responsibilities
* building out the microsite
* creating “best content” algorithm
* creating moderation interface to prevent “bad” content from showing up

## Bauer Slapshot Simulator

### Problem Statement
The team at VML NY worked on a proof of concept as part of an RFP for our Bauer client. This pitch included a “smart” hockey stick concept. 

### Solution
We came up with the idea of the “smart” hockey stick as something that would help hockey players get an understanding of their playing style by tracking the velocity of the puck based on the strength of their snapshot.

The team created a prototype hockey stick with an embedded device that used the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to track the movement of the hockey stick in 3D space and interpolate the speed of the puck. Users would be able to see the speed of their current slapshot, as well as track a history of previous ones.

### Responsibilities
* create prototype “smart” hockey stick
* build interface for users to see data of their slapshots

## Ernst & Young Conference Digital Installation

### Problem Statement
EY holds a yearly conference covering the state of digital across the industry. The conference is attended by a number of director and executive level leaders in the space. The team at VML NY created an interactive installation that engaged the conference attendees with thoughts, news, and their own content.

### Solution
To engage conference attendees, we needed to give the relevant content and to tie back to their experiences, they also needed to related to it. The team created a website that was fed curated content coming from the following categories:

* video
* images
* quotes
* event reminders
* timetables

Additional content was delivered via attendees posting on Twitter with a specific hashtag. An automatically generated slideshow was broadcast to a set of TV walls along the hallways to help attendees view useful information about the conference, get inspired, and see their own content, as well as content of others around them in the form of tweets.

### Responsibilities
* create concept for interactive installation
* create website pulling data from admin curated content and users’ tweets
* create moderation interface for content admins to curate content
* setup and maintain the installation for the duration of the conference

## Wieden+Kennedy Interactive Wall

### Problem Statement
The team wanted to know what consumers felt about our clients’ brands, in real time.

### Solution
We created the concept of showing consumer sentiment for brands based on how they reacted on social media. Consumer reactions containing the reference to a brand were analyzed and categorized into a “sentiment bucket”, for example:

* happy
* angry
* sad
* indiferent
* curious
* upset

This data was processed through an NLP engine and subsequently color coded to an emotional response, i.e. red for “angry” or green for “happy”. Afterwards, these sentiments were visualized as “bubbles” embedded into the client logo. Each bubble could be tapped to open it and see the actual social media reaction. The data was updated regularly so that live sentiment was visible.

As a result, when Nike, for instance, released a new Jordan sneaker and the consumers’ general reaction was “hey, this design sucks”, the interactive wall would present the Nike swoosh logo filled with primarily red circles. On the contrary, when Delta released an extremely fun safety video and consumers found if funny and like it, the Delta logo would be displayed with “positive” colors.

### Responsibilities
* surveying the office space for potential locations
* working on prototype application
* creating NLP engine to analyze consumer sentiment from social media
