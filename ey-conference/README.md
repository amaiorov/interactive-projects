# Ernst & Young Conference Digital Installation

## Overview
EY holds a yearly conference covering the state of digital across the industry. The conference is attended by a number of director and executive level leaders in the space. The team at VML NY created an interactive installation that engaged the conference attendees with thoughts, news, and their own content.

## Solution
To engage conference attendees, we needed to give the relevant content and to tie back to their experiences, they also needed to related to it. The team created a website that was fed curated content coming from the following categories:

* video
* images
* quotes
* event reminders
* timetables

Additional content was delivered via attendees posting on Twitter with a specific hashtag. An automatically generated slideshow was broadcast to a set of TV walls along the hallways to help attendees view useful information about the conference, get inspired, and see their own content, as well as content of others around them in the form of tweets.

## Responsibilities
* create concept for interactive installation
* create website pulling data from admin curated content and usersâ€™ tweets
* create moderation interface for content admins to curate content
* setup and maintain the installation for the duration of the conference
